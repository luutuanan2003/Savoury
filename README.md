This native iOS application uses MobileNetV2 machine learning model to detect ingredient and pass those into a free online REST API to generate suitable recipe according to user's culinary preferences.
That is pretty much sums it up.
Below is the explaination the application's purpose and design:

Purpose of the App:
The backstory for the proposal of the app is quite interesting as it came from our experience living together as roommates. And every time we go grocery shopping and come home with a lot of fresh produce to cook. However, it is difficult to create new recipes since we are not hyper-fixated on one dish and like to try something new. Thus, an idea for an app was born.
“Savoury” is a cooking app that helps users create dishes with current components. Its additional aims include making those who are new to cooking feel at ease in the kitchen, encouraging people to cook instead of eating out to save money, and cutting grocery costs by generating recipes utilizing current products.
Following that, it connects to the database using an API key and recommends several cuisines that can be prepared using the ingredients provided. Furthermore, users can save, search, and share their own recipes, increasing convenience in certain scenarios while also fostering a community of cooking enthusiasts.

Apple's HIG Design Considerations:
1. App Icon: The app icon should be the first impression of this project, and Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) tell us to keep it simple, avoid using too many UI components, export the resource as a square image (Apple Developer n.d.), and design our own app icon using the "Apple Design Resources" in "Sketch" and "Figma". Thus, we just catch the major appeal for our app icon, the "Snap and Cook" feature, with the chef hat representing the cooking and the camera representing the capturing.
2. Designing for iOS: To improve the user experience with the app, HIG recommends limiting the number of control options and allowing the user to focus on their primary goal (Apple Developer n.d.), which in this case is cooking. Instead of the user providing individual input for the ingredients, a picture shot from their iOS device will be processed using Apple's "Visual Look Up" to determine the ingredients' names for the input data. This allows “Savoury” to distinguish itself from other culinary applications with superior functionality.
3. Color: Also, we have taken the advice of not using too much color in nongame apps as it may cause people to be distracted and disorientated (Apple Developer n.d.). Choosing the color yellow to be our main theme as it incites hunger and has a very positive impact.
4. Icons and SF Symbols: Best practices that HIG said to be recognizable or consistent throughout our app (Apple Developer n.d.). We achieved that by using SF Symbols. SF Symbols intergrates seemlessly by Apple which made it easy to render different modes to it and choose which one suits the most to our own aesthetic.

Finally here is a short demonstration video of the application:
